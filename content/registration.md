## Registration Entry Requirements and Update Process

1. Each entry must include a unique protocol, where the scope of uniqueness is
   the protocol itself.
2. Each entry should include a link that references a public available
   specification (PAS) that defines the trace context [[!TRACE-CONTEXT]]
   serialization and deserialization for that protocol.
3. Each entry must include contact information of the requestor.

An update to this registry is an addition, change or deletion of a protocol. Any
person can request an update to this registry by email notice  to the
[Distributed Tracing  Working
Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/) who will place it on an
upcoming meeting agenda and notify the requestor. Consideration and disposition
of the request is by consensus of the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working
Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). The Chair will then notify
the requestor of the outcome and update the registry accordingly.
